Because datasets are often provided with scant metadata, I want to
infer some of the conventional metadata without depending on special
information. One such sort of metadata is the schema of the dataset.

Special snowflake looks for unique identifiers in arbitrary datasets.
Run it like so. ::

    from special_snowflake import fromcsv
    from pprint import pprint
    with open('open-data-index.csv') as fp:
        pprint(fromcsv(csv.DictReader(fp), n_columns = 2, only_adjacent = False))

This program will find all of the combinations of one or two columns
inside ``open-data-index.csv`` that function as unique indices on the
full spreadsheet.
